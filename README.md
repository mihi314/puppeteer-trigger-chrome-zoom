A minimal repository to demonstrate triggering native chrome zoom with puppeteer (which only works in non-headless mode)
Context: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57802309/is-there-a-way-to-trigger-standard-zoom-not-headless

How to run:

1. `npm install`
2. `node main.js`

A chrome instance controlled by puppeteer should open an example page and then zoom to 50%.
